P.S. this uses the MIT licence.  
### NOTICE
This program will not install anything to your machine.  
This program is a **JOKE** and shall not be taken seriously.  
All it does is fake a loading bar and commands.  

### Description
With this program you can relive the sudo pacman -Syu experience!  
Features include:  
* Realistic Loading Times!  
* Hangs at 99%!  
* ALWAYS has a error at the end just like with a real package manager! (im looking at you, APT on Pop!_OS.)  
* NEVER works properly!
* Authentic looking loading bar!
